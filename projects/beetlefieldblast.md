# Beetlefield Blast

> *Explosive fruit. Armored bugs. One ticking time bomb.*

In this frantic arena brawler, you play as fantastical, weapon-wielding beetles locked in a high-stakes battle over a ticking explosive fruit bomb. Your goal? Smack that bomb toward the enemy’s side before it blows—and pray it doesn’t blow up on yours.
