# Build String Unity Project

---

For my game engine fundamentals course, I made this simple game to demonstrate my understanding of the key features of unity.
This was made over the course of half a semester whilst going over the unity engine. The focus was put on the engine and game mechanics.

I received the keywords 'build' and 'string' as inspiration for my unity game demo.
This evolved into a focus on some satisfying abilities. I made a dragging ability, a binding ability and an ability to control electrical objects. All got some simple color coding, and I made some small levels to demonstrate these abilities.
