# Salt Train Unreal Engine Project

For my game engine fundamentals course, I made this simple game to demonstrate my understanding of the key features of unreal engine.
This was made over the course of half a semester whilst going over the unreal engine. The focus was put on the engine and game mechanics.

I received the keywords 'salt' and 'train' as inspiration for my unreal engine game demo.
I ended making a simple endless type of game where you have to manage a set of train tracks during the winter.

You have to prevent the tracks from freezing over by throwing salt on the spots that are highlighted. If you are too late, the tracks will freeze over and it will take much more salt to unfreeze them. If a train is held up by a piece of frozen track the delay timer builds up. When the delay gets too high you get fired! ...and of course if you're hit by a train you die.

## My Takeaways

It was very interesting to work with such a powerful engine. Also using the visual scripting features of unreal was a new experience. I got some good experience and a nice taste of unreal and game design during this project.
