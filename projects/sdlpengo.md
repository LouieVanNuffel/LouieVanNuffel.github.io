# SDL2 Pengo Recreation

---

For my programming 4 course, we had to recreate a popular 80's arcade game using a **sdl2 C++ framework** in visual studio.
We had to first apply many engine design patterns and create our **own game engine** using a 'composition over inheritance' mindset.

The full project is available on github, where I go over the engine patterns that were used. It goes over patterns from the game loop and game objects to the service locator.

## My Takeaways

It was very insightful to create my own engine using patterns utulized by many mainstream engines such as unity. I believe this project honed my C++ skills and gave me a much deeper understanding of game engines and game design.
