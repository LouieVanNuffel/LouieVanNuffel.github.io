# SDL2 Pengo Recreation

---

For my programming 4 course, we had to recreate a popular 80's arcade game using a **sdl2 C++ framework** in visual studio. I got assigned Pengo.
We had to first apply many engine design patterns and create our **own game engine** using a 'composition over inheritance' mindset.

The full project is available on github, where I go over the engine patterns that were used. It goes over patterns from the game loop and game objects to the service locator.

The levels in the project and loaded from from binary files.

## My Takeaways

It was very insightful to create my own engine using patterns utulized by many mainstream engines such as unity. I believe this project honed my C++ skills and gave me a much deeper understanding of game engines and game design.
